# Readme for Project Assignments

This is a general readme file. Each `project-*` directory contains a
project-specific `README.md` file. 


The `Makefile` at the top directory only provides two functionalities:
cleanup and submission-specific.

## Cleanup command

To clean up the top directory and each `project-*` sub-directory, type

    $ make distclean


## Submission-specific command

To create a compressed archive that you should submit as your final submission, type 

    $ make submit

Pay attention to the printed messages.
